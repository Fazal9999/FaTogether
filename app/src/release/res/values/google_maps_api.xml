    TODO: Before you release your application, you need a Google Maps API row_key.

    To do this, you can either add your release row_key credentials to your existing
    row_key, or create a new row_key.

    Note that this file specifies the API row_key for the release build target.
    If you have previously set up a row_key for the debug target with the debug signing certificate,
    you will also need to set up a row_key for your release certificate.

    Follow the directions here:

    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/signup

    Once you have your row_key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
